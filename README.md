# AverageFace

Calculate the average face by delaunay triangulation with out OpenCV dependency.

This project was originated from [learnopencv.com](http://www.learnopencv.com/average-face-opencv-c-python-tutorial/), while in running the code example, I found it is disturbing to install OpenCV correctly, so I rewrite the code, use ONLY python PIL library to reimplement it.

The Delaunay Triangulation part was from [pyDelaunay2D](https://github.com/jmespadero/pyDelaunay2D), thanks a lot!
